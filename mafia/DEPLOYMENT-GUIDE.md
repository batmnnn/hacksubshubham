## 🚀 Current Deployment Status

Your Mafia game frontend is being deployed to Vercel! The build process is currently running.

## 📋 Deployment Options

### 1. Vercel (Currently Deploying)

```

## 🔧 Configuration for Production

### Environment Variables (if needed)
The app is configured to work without server-side environment variables, but you can add:

```env
# Optional: Analytics
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=your_google_analytics_id

# Optional: Custom RPC (already configured for Monad)
NEXT_PUBLIC_MONAD_RPC=https://testnet-rpc.monad.xyz
```
